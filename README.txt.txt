Description of Third Report:
My third report for this project is the 'Contact Appointments Report', which displays the total number of appointments for each contact in a given month. When the user first selects the
'Contact Appointments' button from the Main Menu, the table displays all appointments for each contact in the database. The appointments are grouped by month and contact name. Using the 
drop-down choicebox located at the top of the screen, a user can select a calendar month to view the total number of appointments for each contact name.
